# SRAM-for-high-computing

This project focuses on improving the power efficiency of SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) used in high-speed computing systems. Traditional 6T SRAM designs face problems with power usage and stability when operating at high frequencies. To address this, the project explores a new 8T SRAM design that uses transmission gates.

The 8T design helps reduce both static and dynamic power consumption, lowers leakage currents, and minimizes read disturbances during fast operations. Simulations were carried out using Cadence Virtuoso software on CMOS technologies at 180nm, 90nm, and 45nm, across frequencies of 500 MHz, 1 GHz, and 2 GHz.

The results showed that the 8T SRAM performs better than the traditional 6T design in terms of power savings and stability. This makes it a promising option for future digital systems that require faster and more energy-efficient memory. Future improvements will focus on reducing the extra area used by the added transistors and improving the power-delay product (PDP).
